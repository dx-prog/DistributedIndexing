tools, or command line from various sources.

# FEATURE SET TODO
The following is a set of ideal features for my research project.

## SEARCH DATABASE FEATURES
The intent is to support saving and searching objects into searchable 
databases where in the search is handled by services, and the queries
and scripting interface are abstracted away from database concerns. The
user of the system is intended only to have to worry about their specific
programming language, and not the underlying connectivity to any particular
database, or set of databases in the case of distributed search.

## SEARCHABLE FORMATS
The intent is to be able to store documents of various formats into a
database for seach wherein the extract is handled by services. The formats
intended to be supported are as follows:
* XML
* JSON
* HTML
* PLAIN
* OPENXML

## SEARCH METHODS
My desire is to make the project scriptable and usable in multiple languages. The 
current set of languages targeted are as follows:
* CSHARP
* Python (IronPython)
* Ruby (IronRuby)
* F#

## ANALYSIS FEATURES
This project is intended to make exploring data and the relationships there-in (data-mining)
easier.
